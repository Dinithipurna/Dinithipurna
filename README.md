Welcome to my GitHub profile(My personal page is currently under construction, so hope you get a rough idea of myself and my work through this page:D)! 

I'm Dinithi Dissanayake, a passionate researcher and Data Engineer currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computing at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in July 2022.

## What I do ...

- Currently I am working on my Ph.D. research on the lines of Human Centered Machine Learning combined with VR, MR techniques.

- During my undergraduate studies, I delved into the fascinating world of 3D Object Transformation and Regeneration for Privacy in Mixed Reality for my final year research project. This project not only allowed me to explore 3D point cloud representations but also led to the development of a novel 3D vision algorithm for user-controllable privacy of 3D objects. 


## Professional Experience

In the professional realm, I contributed as a Data Engineer at Axiata Digital Labs (ADL) Pvt. Ltd. for 2+ years. At ADL, I've been involved in industry-related projects, particularly in the telecommunications sector. My role revolves around providing solutions through big data analysis and leveraging machine/deep learning techniques. I also worked as a data engineering consultant for LIRNEAsia Pvt. Ltd.

## Interesting Facts About Me
